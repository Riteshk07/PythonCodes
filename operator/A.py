'''If op is a two-argument operator (this is a very important condition) and the operator is used in the following context:

variable = variable op expression

It can be simplified and shown as follows:

variable op= expression

Take a look at the examples below. Make sure you understand them all.

i = i + 2 * j ⇒ i += 2 * j

var = var / 2 ⇒ var /= 2

rem = rem % 10 ⇒ rem %= 10

j = j - (i + var + rem) ⇒ j -= (i + var + rem)

x = x ** 2 ⇒ x **= 2
