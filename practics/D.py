'''Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers  and  representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . Print a list of all possible coordinates given by  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, . Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise.

Example




All permutations of  are:
.

Print an array of the elements that do not sum to .


Input Format

Four integers  and , each on a separate line.

Constraints

Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.

Sample Input 0

Sample Output 0

[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
Explanation 0

Each variable  and  will have values of  or . All permutations of lists in the form .
Remove all arrays that sum to  to leave only the valid permutations.
