Dictionaries and lists share the following characteristics:

* Both are mutable.
* Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.
* Both can be nested. A list can contain another list. A dictionary can contain another dictionary.
 	A dictionary can also contain a list, and vice versa.

Dictionaries differ from lists primarily in how elements are accessed:

	List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.
	Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.

Defining a Dictionary
* Dictionaries are Pythonâ€™s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. 
	A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.

* You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). 
	A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value:
